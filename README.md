# ðŸ§  Unix Philosophy in Practice 

Welcome! This repo is a small side project where I explore and apply the timeless principles of the Unix philosophy â€” one script at a time.

Each directory in this repo contains a minimal shell script that focuses on a single Unix principle. The goal isn't to build something huge, but rather to understand **why** Unix tools are so effective â€” and how that mindset leads to better code.

## ðŸ“Œ Why this project?

We use tools like `grep`, `cat`, `ls`, or `find` every day, but rarely think about **why** they work so well together. It's not just about functionality it's about a design philosophy that's been around for decades.

This project is my attempt to:
- Practice writing small, composable scripts.
- Revisit core Unix principles by applying them.
- Build a reference for myself (and maybe others too) to stay grounded in simplicity.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

You just need a Bash shell (v4+ ideally) and a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.).

To try one out:

```bash
cd 01_do-one-thing-well/
chmod +x log_cleaner.sh
./log_cleaner.sh /path/to/logs
